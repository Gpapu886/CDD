# Caries Detection Dataset（CDD）
Our paper "Enhanced YOLOv5 Model with Dual Attention Mechanisms for Accurate Detection of Dental Caries in Children" is under review, and we decide to public our dataset in advance. 

I. Introduction
The caries detection dataset is a dataset of about 2000 images, all of which were taken by smartphones or other electronic devices with camera functions. The images were taken from different angles, such as those taken with professional oral instruments and at standard angles, or those taken in an environment without professional oral instruments.
